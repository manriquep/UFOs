# **UFOs**

**Overview of the analysis**

Our client Dana has decided she would like the UFO sightings data table we have built to be filtered even further. She would like for us to include the ability to filter by more column headers and to pinpoint a search by date and country.

**Purpose**

- Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
- Update and deploy (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
- Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

**Results**

Image one shows the final webpage after the filters were added.

These are the steps to perform a search using the filters:

Step 1: The user will enter the date and the city they would like to display in the table (See Image Two)

Step 2: The user can filter the search by adding a shape as shown in Image Three.

**Summary**

Although the webpage includes UFO sightings, a drawback is that it only includes information for the year 2010. A recommendation for further development of this webpage would be to include a calendar so that users can pick the date and month instead of typing it in. Another recommendation is to add a drop down button once clicked to allow users to pick the information. The current placeholder does a great job directing the user to the correct format for data entry.
